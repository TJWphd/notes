# Notes

## Description

This is a note-taking app allowing users to create, save, edit, and delete notes.

## Features

This app uses server-side storage and express routes in JavaScript, unlike earlier projects which utilized client-side local storage. This app includes a delete route, which is a bonus feature beyond the MVP.
